          <p> My favorite hobby is watching anime! Anime always has some sort of drama in them that makes it interesting. I like anime sometimes of the story or the look of the charcters. I like mangas too but I prefer the watching rather then reading. You can learn stuff from anime too! Not all of them, probably most of them. Anime can be funny too! Not all animes are life-death sort of thing. Animes have multiple seasons you can look for.The characters in anime always look so cool! For instance, in the anime 'Demon Slayer' there's a boy called Tomioka Giy√∫ he has black hair tied up into a low messy ponytail. He's my favorite charcter due to him kind of acting like my friend! Norman from The Promised Neverland is my favorite charcter! He has white hair and is smart but lacks physical strength.For me, anime sometimes relieves me when I have some stress with work.</p>
